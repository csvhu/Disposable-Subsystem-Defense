# Disposable Subsystem Defense

## Sponge Mesh Architecture
The sponge mesh architecture is a robust design pattern employed to ensure seamless integration and communication between various components in a distributed system. This architecture prioritizes adaptability and resilience, enabling services to interact fluidly while maintaining performance and scalability.

## Services
Within the sponge mesh framework, services are modular and self-contained. Each service can independently manage its lifecycle, enabling rapid deployment and updates without affecting other components. This separation of concerns enhances maintainability and allows teams to focus on specific functionalities, fostering innovation and efficiency.

## Bridges
Bridges in the sponge mesh architecture act as facilitators, enabling communication between disparate services. They ensure that data is transferred accurately and securely, acting as a translator when necessary to accommodate different data formats and protocols. This ensures that services can work together harmoniously, even if they were built on different technology stacks.
